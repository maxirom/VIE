// transformation rule, is a syntactic rule or function which takes premises and
// returns a conclusion. Stanbol Rules allows to add a layer for expressing 
// business logics by means of axioms, which encode the inference rules. These 
// axioms can be organized into a container called recipe, which identifies a set 
// of rules that share the same business logic and interpret them as a whole."
