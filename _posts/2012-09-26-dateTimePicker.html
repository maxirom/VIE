<p> <br/>
VIE Editable DateTimePicker assists with editing date-annotations. It recognizes entities from a content and for each entity it can visualize the relevant information, such as its date-attributes and all of its filled-out attributes. The information is visualized in form of a card, where the user can select date-attributes and edit them, by selecting date values from a provided calendar. The non-date attributes are also visualized to let a user better orient in existing semantic dependencies between different entities and between different date-attributes of one entity.
</p>
<p>
DateTimePicker will identify the semantic dependencies relevant for a valid date range of input, if this can be inferred from the given annotations. As a result, DateTimePicker will give a recommendation for input's upper and lower bounds.
